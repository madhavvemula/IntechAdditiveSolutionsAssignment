If you have two matrices:

Matrix A of size n × n

Matrix B of size n × n

The product matrix C = A × B will also be of size n × n.

STEPS:

Take input of Matrix A and Matrix B.

Initialize a result matrix C of size n × n with all zeros.

Apply 3 nested loops:

Loop for row i of Matrix A.

Loop for column j of Matrix B.

Loop for k to perform multiplication and summation.

Print the resultant Matrix C.




In short:

Outer Loop: Go through each row i of Matrix A.

Middle Loop: Go through each column j of Matrix B.

Inner Loop: Multiply elements of row i in A with column j in B and sum them up.
