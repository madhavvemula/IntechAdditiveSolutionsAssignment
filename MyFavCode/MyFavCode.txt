One piece of code I am proud of is the Spotify Clone project I built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

The project replicates the core UI and basic functionality of the Spotify music player.
Users can:
See a list of songs with album art.
Play/Pause songs.
Navigate to next/previous songs.
Seek through the progress bar.


What I implemented:

In this project, I used the following:

HTML & Bootstrap to design a clean and responsive layout.

CSS for custom styling and making it visually close to Spotify.

JavaScript’s Audio API to handle:

Play/Pause toggle.

Next/Previous track functionality.

Dynamic updating of progress bar and current song info.

Event listeners to capture user actions.

Why am I proud of this project?
Because this project helped me understand: ✅ DOM Manipulation in-depth.
    How to work with real-time audio events.
    Handling state changes like play, pause, and song switching.
    Making the UI responsive and interactive using JavaScript and Bootstrap.

It was the first time I connected UI + Logic + Media, and seeing it all come together gave me confidence to build real-world projects.
