 The function checks if one rectangle is completely to the left/right or completely above/below the other.
 If either condition is true, the rectangles do not overlap (return false).
 Otherwise, they must be overlapping, so we return true.
 The main method tests this logic with sample rectangles and prints whether they intersect or not.
