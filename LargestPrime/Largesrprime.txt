We are trying to find the largest 5-digit prime number present in the first 100 digits of Pi.
Pi digits are stored as a String because:
If we store them as an int or double, Java cannot store so many digits correctly.
We want to extract 5 digits at a time  substring() works easily on String.

We use a for loop to go from i = 0 to i = 95.
Why till pi.length() - 5? Because we want to take 5 digits at a time,so last index should be 95 (as 95 + 5 = 100).

Inside the loop: pi.substring(i, i + 5) â†’ takes 5 digits starting from index i,then we convert that string into an integer using Integer.parseInt().
And then we check the num variable is prime or not if it is prime return it 
If the 5-digit number is prime and larger than the previous largest , we update maxPri.
After checking all possible 5-digit numbers , we print the largest prime found.
