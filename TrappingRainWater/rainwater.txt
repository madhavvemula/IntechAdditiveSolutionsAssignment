how i solve this problem:

1.Use two pointers (left and right) starting at both ends.

-->  Keep track of maximum heights on both sides (leftMax and rightMax).

--> Move the pointer with the smaller height:

-->If leftMax is smaller, move left forward and calculate trapped water at left.

-->If rightMax is smaller, move right backward and calculate trapped water at right.

-->Keep adding trapped water until the pointers meet.
