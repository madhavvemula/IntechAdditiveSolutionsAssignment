The program consists of three main functions:
  ----> First Compressor: compress(String s)
            logic for this is : It counts consecutive occurrences of characters and replaces them with char + count.("aabcccccaaa" → "a2b1c5a3)
                                steps to follow:
                                    Traverse the string.
                                    If the next character is different, append char + count to the result.
                                    Reset the count for the next character.
    ----->SecondCompressor: optimizeCompression(String s)
          logic:This function removes 1s, making the output smaller.("a2b1c5a3" → "ab2c5a3" (removes "b1" → "b"))
                    steps to follow :
                                Traverse the compressed string.
                                Extract numeric values and ignore 1s.
                                Reconstruct the optimized string.
    -----> Decompressor: decompress(String s)
            logic:Takes a compressed string and reconstructs the original string.("ab2c5a3" → "aabbcaaaaa");
                  steps to follow:
                                Traverse the string.
                                Extract numbers after characters and repeat that character accordingly.
                                Append the expanded result.


        This  methods ensures that the compression is efficient and reversible.
